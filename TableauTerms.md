- Joins/unions
    -Using a join or a union will combine two tables into one 
- Bar Chart
    - Place a dimension on the rows shelf and a measure on the columns shelf, and vice versa
- Line Chart
- Scatterplot
    - Place at least one measure on the columns shelf and at least one measure on the rows shelf
- Create a map
    - Prerequsite: your data source must contain location data (location names, latitude or longitude coordiantes, etc)
- Combined axis chart
    - This merges two or more measures into a single axis so you can plot as many measures as you'd like in the same chary
- Dual axis chart
    - This creates two independent acis (Which you can syncronize) that you can plot two seperate measures on the same chart. It lets you create seperate marks cards for each measure
- Scacked bar
    -
